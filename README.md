## What is YasuiJS?

Yasui (meaning "easy" in Japanese) is a lightweight Express-based framework for Node.js that brings the developer experience of modern frameworks without the complexity and maintaining minimal dependencies. It provides the structure you need with just the features you'll actually use.

## Features Summary
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built on Express with minimal dependencies. Focus on essentials without the bloat
- **Complete Error Handling**: Everything can throw without try/catch - automatic error handling everywhere
- **Automatic Type-Casting**: Query params automatically converted to proper types. Even in middlewares
- **Flexible DI System**: Constructor and method-level injection with configurable scopes for better control
- **Simple Middlewares**: Apply at global, controller, or route level. Use the same decorators as controllers
- **Rich Swagger Generation**: Flexible decorators for enums, arrays, classes, OpenAPI schemas.
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install yasui
```

```ts
import yasui, { Controller, Get } from 'yasui';

@Controller('/')
export class AppController {
  @Get('/')
  hello() {
    return { message: 'Hello World!' };
  }
}

yasui.createServer({
  controllers: [AppController]
});
```

## Why YasuiJS?

YasuiJS adopts a **class-based, object-oriented approach** with decorators, bringing significant architectural advantages over traditional functional Express.js approaches:

### Better Code Organization
Classes and decorators provide better organization, encapsulation, and maintainability. This approach naturally supports established architectural patterns like onion architecture, hexagonal architecture, and clean architecture.

### Dependency Injection
Built-in dependency injection enables loose coupling, better testability, and cleaner separation of concerns. Dependencies are explicitly declared and automatically resolved.

### Declarative Over Imperative
Instead of manually registering routes and extracting parameters, you declare what you want using decorators. The framework handles the implementation details.
